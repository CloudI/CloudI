    * Update http://cloudi.org with css theme switcher for print mode

2012-03-09 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Use trie:find_match/2 instead of trie:find/2 within the list_pg_data
      module to provide pattern matching with service name strings
      (provided for CloudI API message send operations) so that a
      subscribed service name with a "*" wildcard character matches
      1 or more characters, while preferring the most exact match possible
      (so "/a/b/c" will still match "/a/b/c", not "/*")
    * Provide the subscribed service name as the "pattern" parameter for
      all CloudI service callback functions and the CloudI API return functions
      (i.e., so the pattern parameter provides what the service passed to the
       subscribe function, while the name parameter provides what the send
       operation was given as a destination)
    * Rename cloudi_job_sup.erl to cloudi_dispatcher_sup.erl to avoid the
      cloudi_job_ prefix because of the cloudi_job behavior usage

2012-03-03 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Rename cloudi_job_dispatcher.erl to cloudi_dispatcher.erl to avoid the

    * Provide better seeding for random:uniform/1

2012-02-25 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add service options for optional parameters that control
      typical service defaults for: priority_default, queue_limit,
      dest_refresh_start, dest_refresh_delay
    * If cloudi_logger output is redirected to a different node, and it is
      listed as a configured node, it is monitored for
      disconnection/reconnection so that logging can be done locally if
      necessary (i.e., while the node is known to be disconnected).
    * Fix random:uniform/1 usage so that a seed is assigned
      based on erlang:now/1
    * Rename "2" suffix module names to avoid Erlang module name conflicts with
      other Erlang applications:
        array2.erl -> cloudi_array.erl
        lists2.erl -> cloudi_lists.erl
        math2.erl -> cloudi_math.erl
        pool2.erl -> cloudi_pool.erl
        pool2_sup.erl -> cloudi_pool_sup.erl
        proplists2.erl -> cloudi_proplists.erl

    * Prevent external services from receiving messages prematurely
    * Changes to make sure a failed send to an external service's OS pid
      causes the service to terminate

2012-01-15 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add priority queuing to Erlang services
    * Add timeout events to remove any requests that remain within the
      priority queue after the request timeout expires
      (so no processing needs to occur on queued requests that have already
       timed-out, such that the response is ignored)
    * Reduce request timeouts by the time spent queued waiting to be processed
    * Erlang services now handle requests within a short-lived process to help
      avoid garbage collection latency
    * The hexpi test Erlang service was partially re-written to be more
      event-driven (avoiding problems with accumulated timeout latency)
    * Add the node to all log lines (important when using 
      log redirect configuration)
    * Delay node reconnect attempts to allow for normal startup time

2012-01-05 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add floating point number usage for process and thread counts, so that
      it represents a ceil for numbers > 1.0 or a round for numbers < 1.0
      when using it as a multiple of the number of cores
      (i.e., scheduler threads)
    * Make sure GET query parameters are accumulated in order as a list
      when necessary, within the CloudI API
    * Add the ability to redirect log output to a different Erlang node

2011-12-11 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * CloudI version 0.1.9 (alpha) released

2011-12-09 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add C++ CloudI API interface, based on the C CloudI API and integrated
      with the hexpi test
    * Make recv_async return the oldest response when given a null UUID
      (cloudi_constants.erl can change the RECV_ASYNC_STRATEGY to the faster
       "random" strategy)
    * Change various asserts to instead throw message decoding exceptions or
      invalid input exceptions within the CloudI API implementations
    * Add interface to restart a job through the CloudI Job API

2011-12-04 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Change the external job configuration to not rely on command-line
      arguments to avoid replicating configuration values
      (instead use automatically assigned environmental variables,
       managed by the CloudI API source code)

2011-12-03 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add the python and ruby variations on the msg_size test

    * Move cloudi_job_misultin to be cloudi_job_http

2011-12-02 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add java msg_size test and make the java socket handling more robust
    * Catch cloudi_job Erlang module timeout exceptions and return as the
      expected error timeout return value
    * Add request_info parsing (expected to always be key/value pairs)

2011-11-30 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Change external tcp job handling to utilize a 4 byte header
      (so the max total message size possible for tcp jobs becomes 2GB, but
       udp jobs are likely to be limited to 16KB
       (with the current code and a normal loopback MTU))
    * Fix a queuing bug with forward operations
    * Add msg_size test for testing messages > 16KB but < 4MB (currently 2MB)
      (with the current CloudI API settings, the 4MB limit can be increased)
    * Add timeout decrement for forward operations to prevent infinite messages
    * Fix stderr/stdout stream buffering in the Java CloudI API
    * Add the ability to forward with new job state within an Erlang CloudI job

2011-11-27 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * Add code path add/remove/get operations to the CloudI Job API, to provide
      an easy way for the code paths to be modified before an internal job is
      started in a directory CloudI's code server isn't aware of.

      request_http_qs_parse function for storing the parsed HTTP query string

2011-08-16 Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

    * http_req C test now handles query strings
    * All requests and responses now have a terminating null ('\0')
      character that is not included in their length, so that it is
      easier to use C string functions without errors
