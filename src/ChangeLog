    * pgsql, mysql, TokyoTyrant, couchdb, memcached data modules converted
      to the cloudi_job behavior, though the binary responses need work

	* CloudI version 0.0.10 (alpha)
	    * add a JSON RPC server for the Cloudi API function calls
		  based on the LShift JSON RPC implementation
		  (http://www.lshift.net/blog/2007/02/17/json-and-json-rpc-for-erlang)
		* add abstract code generation for automatic
		  JSON RPC function call integration
		* update referenced Erlang version to R13B02
		  (to reflect the version currently deployed by faxien)

2010-03-06	Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

	* CloudI version 0.0.9 (alpha)
		* bug fixes
			* do not purge the cloud_logger_interface module when
			  changing the logging level
			* prevent a crash when jobs ignore the task size parameter
			  (though the database may die after a severe timeout
			  if results are generated faster than the database can store them,
			  when ignoring the task size and not using load balancing or the
			  task time target to reduce the load on the database)
			* fixed a cloud scheduler bug for running multiple jobs
			  that use the 'all' process count configuration setting
		* added a N dimensional index (Erlang) iterator
		  (src/lib/cloud_stdlib/src/nd_index.erl)
		* added useful cloud job source code in src/lib/cloud_job_stdlib/
		* make gcc and boost versions build configuration items
		* update g++ to 4.4.2 and boost to 1.42

2009-10-29	Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

	* CloudI version 0.0.8 (alpha)
		* add CouchDB database module
		* add ememcached functionality for creating a cluster
		* add workInstance as a parameter to the do_work function
		  in the work library (i.e., changed cloud_work_interface.hpp).
		  The combination of the workInstance with the id will be unique
		  for all work processed by the work module within a Cloudi instance.

2009-10-14	Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

	* CloudI version 0.0.7 (alpha)
		* add Tokyo Tyrant database module
		* cleanup the memcached interface a little
		* add cloud_job_latency work module for testing
		  system latency with machines that have their clocks
		  synchronized
		* add to the Erlang work module behavior the callback
		  "handle_drain_binary_output" for handling the
		  "binary" data title which is automatically routed to the
		  Erlang work module that created the work
		  (in the same order the work was created)

2009-10-10	Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

	* CloudI version 0.0.6 (alpha)
		* cleanup other parts of the WorkerController code in the
		  cloud_worker_port process
		* add a wait for the ThreadPool exit
		* add PostgreSQL "?" parameter substitution with
		  expression operators
		* automatically download g++ and boost from mirrors instead
		  of requiring their presence within the source repository

2009-10-09	Michael Truog   <mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

	* CloudI version 0.0.5 (alpha)
		* make the cloud_worker_port process thread pool stable
			* rewrite of ThreadPool
			* reference count object pool allocator to avoid
			  deletion order problems (with safe_shared_ptr)
		* add MySQL support with emysql and cloud_data_mysql
		* add (optional) usage of cloud_data_mysql in cloud_job_tests
		* provide the same parameter substitution as MySQL for the PostgreSQL
		  interface ("?" instead of "$1", "$2", "$3", etc., so that queries
		  can be as similar as possible when using the equery/3 function
		  for either PostgreSQL or MySQL
			* currently handles punctuation but not operators
			  (so spaces are currently required on either side of the "?")
		* disable ptmalloc for now because of problems with gmp taking the
		  libc malloc
		* update g++ to 4.4.1 and boost to 1.40

2009-10-03	Michael Truog	<mjtruog [at] gmail (dot) com>

	* CloudI version 0.0.4 (alpha)
		* shortnames are currently the only supported node names
		* fix problems when storing work data in the data repository
		* create the cloud_interface application, for easier development
		  of dependent cloud_data applications
		* create the cloud_data_memcached application so that memcached
		  commands can be issued as an Erlang tuple passed as a list
		  (for the query text)
