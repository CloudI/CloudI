CloudI changed dramatically between the versions 0.0.10 and 0.1.0.
So, a build system now is in place that doesn't force locally compiled
dependencies.  However, the release part of the build process is not tested
and should not work properly yet.  The same functionality ("make run") found
in 0.0.10 that starts CloudI, works in 0.1.0 (see below).

RUNNING

To compile CloudI, do the following steps:

1) ./autogen.sh

2) ./configure

3) make

After CloudI has been compiled, you can start CloudI with:

1) make run

(on the Erlang prompt)

2) application:start(crypto), application:start(public_key), application:start(ssl), application:start(epgsql), application:start(ecouchdb), application:start(emysql), application:start(ememcached), application:start(etokyotyrant), application:start(misultin), application:start(sasl), application:start(cloudi).


Once a proper release can be built, manually starting applications will
no longer be necessary.  Manually starting applications is clearly 
undesirable and is not meant for a production setup.  I will resolve this
soon when I get more time.
