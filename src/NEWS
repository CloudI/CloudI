  Version 1.0.0 (beta) released.

  * loadtest to show performance of various languages under load
    (results/config at src/tests/http_req/loadtest/)
  * HTTP support is now improved after tweaks during loadtesting
  * virtual host option in HTTP support

April 14, 2012
  Version 0.2.0 rc2 (beta) released.

  * many bugfixes
  * messaging test is now implemented in Erlang, C++, Ruby, Java, and Python
  * added alternative function pointer parameters for C++ CloudI API usage
    so that there is no need to create std::string objects

March 26, 2012
  Version 0.2.0 rc1 (beta) released.

  * support for Erlang R15
  * added support for using service name patterns
    (i.e., names that include the "*" wildcard character)
  * added priority queueing to Erlang services
  * added timeout handling to expire queued requests and now update the request
    timeout based on the time spent queued
  * added log output redirection with automatic partition tolerance
    (i.e., redirect local log output to a remote node and if contact with the
     remote node is lost, log locally until the connection is reestablished)
  * added floating point usage for configuring process and thread counts
    (so that it represents a ceil for numbers > 1.0 or
     a round for numbers < 1.0 when using it as a multiple of the
     number of cores (i.e., Erlang VM scheduler threads))
  * added service options to the CloudI configuration so that typical
    defaults are easily modified
  * other fixes and enhancements (see ChangeLog)

December 12, 2011
  Version 0.1.9 (alpha) released.

  * added request_info/response_info parameters to CloudI messages
  * added the priority parameter to CloudI messages (-128 high to 127 low)
  * new C++ CloudI API (as an alternative to the C CloudI API)
  * prevent CloudI logger flooding from misbehaving services
  * other fixes and enhancements (see ChangeLog)

September 6, 2011
  Version 0.1.8 (alpha) released.
  Changes for HTTP support and robust C API usage.

June 23, 2011
  Version 0.1.7 (alpha) released.
  More build system improvements.

May 14, 2011
  Version 0.1.6 (alpha) released.
  Many build system improvements.

April 25, 2011
  Version 0.1.5 (alpha) released.
  The Job API is finalized with using UUIDs for jobs_remove() and the addition
  of the jobs() request.

April 15, 2011
  Version 0.1.4 (alpha) released.
  The release includes many changes to make the 0.1.x source code robust.
  The Job API now exists with a JSON-RPC interface over HTTP
  (in version 0.0.10 this was the API).  The Job API facilitates dynamic
  configuration of all CloudI functionality.

February 23, 2011
  Version 0.1.0 (alpha) rewrite is now available and
  many changes occurred between the CloudI version 0.0.10 and version 0.1.0.
  The changes are summarized below:
  
  * CloudI is now a naturally master-less distributed system
    (i.e., requires no special configuration or redundancy)
  * messaging can occur between services (i.e., jobs) which
    may exist on other CloudI nodes
  * all service (i.e., job) names rely on strings rather than dynamic atoms,
    lookups use the trie data structure for efficiency close to the performance
    of the process dictionary (the fastest Erlang data structure)
  * cnodes are no longer used for external service (i.e., job) communication,
    instead sockets are used for each thread (either UDP or TCP can be used)
  * external services (i.e., jobs) are no longer implemented in dynamic
    libraries but are instead implemented in executables.  this change makes
    running various VMs or interpreters easy and avoids dynamic library link
    dependency problems with various version dependencies
    (i.e., helps support Java, Python, etc.)
  * HTTP can be used to call services, but JSON-RPC is not supported like it
    was in 0.0.10 (support for JSON-RPC will be added again soon)
  * a normal autotools/rebar build system is used that doesn't attempt to
    install critical dependencies locally (it just requires that they exist)
  * restarting stopped (e.g., SIGSTOP) OS processes is not implemented in
    0.1.0 (but may be added back, as necessary)
