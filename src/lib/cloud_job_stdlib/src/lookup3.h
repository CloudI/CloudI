lookup3.c, by Bob Jenkins, May 2006, Public Domain.

These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final() 
are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included 
if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
the public domain.  It has no warranty.

You probably want to use hashlittle().  hashlittle() and hashbig()
hash byte arrays.  hashlittle() is is faster than hashbig() on
little-endian machines.  Intel and AMD are little-endian machines.
On second thought, you probably want hashlittle2(), which is identical to
hashlittle() except it returns two 32-bit hashes for the price of one.  
You could implement hashbig2() if you wanted but I haven't bothered here.

If you want to find a hash of, say, exactly 7 integers, do
  a = i1;  b = i2;  c = i3;
  mix(a,b,c);
  a += i4; b += i5; c += i6;
  mix(a,b,c);
  a += i7;
  final(a,b,c);
then use c as the hash value.  If you have a variable length array of
4-byte integers to hash, use hashword().  If you have a byte array (like
a character string), use hashlittle().  If you have several byte arrays, or
a mix of things, see the comments above hashlittle().  

Why is this so big?  I read 12 bytes at a time into 3 4-byte integers, 
then mix those integers.  This is fast (you can do a lot more thorough
mixing with 12*3 instructions on 3 integers than you can with 3 instructions
on 1 byte), but shoehorning those bytes into integers efficiently is messy.

 This works on all machines.  To be useful, it requires
 -- that the key be an array of uint32_t's, and
 -- that the length be the number of uint32_t's in the key

 The function hashword() is identical to hashlittle() on little-endian
 machines, and identical to hashbig() on big-endian machines,
 except that the length has to be measured in uint32_ts rather than in
 bytes.  hashlittle() is more complicated than hashword() only because
 hashlittle() has to dance around fitting the key bytes into registers.

hashlittle() -- hash a variable-length key into a 32-bit value
  k       : the key (the unaligned variable-length array of bytes)
  length  : the length of the key, counting by bytes
  initval : can be any 4-byte value
Returns a 32-bit value.  Every bit of the key affects every bit of
the return value.  Two keys differing by one or two bits will have
totally different hash values.

The best hash table sizes are powers of 2.  There is no need to do
mod a prime (mod is sooo slow!).  If you need less than 32 bits,
use a bitmask.  For example, if you need only 10 bits, do
  h = (h & hashmask(10));
In which case, the hash table should have hashsize(10) elements.

If you are hashing n strings (uint8_t **)k, do it like this:
  for (i=0, h=0; i<n; ++i) h = hashlittle( k[i], len[i], h);

Use for hash table lookup, or anything where one collision in 2^^32 is
acceptable.  Do NOT use for cryptographic purposes.
