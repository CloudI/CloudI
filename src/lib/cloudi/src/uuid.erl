%%% ==Erlang UUID Generation==
%%% http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt is the reference for official UUIDs.
%%% This implementation provides a version 1 UUID that includes both the
%%% Erlang pid identifier (ID, Serial, Creation) and the distributed Erlang
%%% node name within the 48 bit node ID.  To make room for the Erlang pid
%%% identifier, the 48 bits from the MAC address
%%% (i.e., 3 OCI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) bytes and
%%% 3 NIC (Network Interface Controller) specific bytes) and
%%% the distributed Erlang node name are bitwise-XORed down to 16 bits.
%%% The Erlang pid is bitwise-XORed from 72 bits down to 32 bits.
%%% The version 3 (MD5), version 4 (random), and version 5 (SHA)
%%% methods are provided as specified within the RFC.

% The RFC said to increment the clock sequence counter
% if the system clock was set backwards.  However, erlang:now/0 always
% provides increasing time values, so this function is not necessary
% when the system clock changes.  Since the version 1 node id contains the
% Erlang PID ID, Serial, and Creation numbers in a (non-destructive)
% bitwise-xor operation, the node id is specific to both the Erlang node
% and the Erlang node lifetime (the PID Creation is different after a node 
% crash). Therefore, it is unclear why this function would be necessary
% within this Erlang implementation of v1 UUID generation (if the system
% is always running). The only event that seems to require this function's
% usage is if the v1 UUID has been stored and retrieved where both actions
% occurred at a point with a system clock change inbetween or possibly
% on different machines with a large difference in system clocks
% (i.e., in some situation that isn't handled by the Erlang VM, so
%  possibly if an external distribution mechanism was used between
%  Erlang VMs, not connected with distributed Erlang).
