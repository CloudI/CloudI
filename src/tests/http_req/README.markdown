#CloudI Loadtesting

## ABOUT

The following requests are available (see loadtest/setup/cloudi.conf):
http://localhost:8080/tests/http_req/erlang.xml?value=42
http://localhost:8080/tests/http_req/c.xml?value=42
http://localhost:8080/tests/http_req/java.xml?value=42
http://localhost:8080/tests/http_req/python.xml?value=42
http://localhost:8080/tests/http_req/ruby.xml?value=42

Which all give the following response, from the associated programming language:
<http_test><value>42</value></http_test>

The loadtest is test data is based on the testing in
http://www.ostinelli.net/a-comparison-between-misultin-mochiweb-cowboy-nodejs-and-tornadoweb/ .
Misultin is used within CloudI currently, but the results of the previous
misultin testing is only loosely related to CloudI loadtesting.
The CloudI loadtesting is using Tsung instead of httperf, so that it is
easier to get more formalized loadtest information.
(see loadtest/setup/http_req_*.xml).
