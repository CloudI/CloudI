# Use this script on Linux if you are unable to install as root but
# you still need to be able to use one or more of the following
# external service configuration options:
# 'chroot', 'limit', 'nice', 'owner', 'syscall_lock'

# The 'cgroup' external service configuration option is unable to be used
# without root execution due to automatic management of the OS pids as they
# start/stop (root is required to add the OS pids to the cgroup).

# Execute the script (after installation) with:
# sudo sh linux_setcap.sh

# Setting a file system capability causes the AT_SECURE == 1 (getauxval)
# secure-execution mode which makes the kernel restrict what the
# OS process may do.  Any usage of ptrace (e.g., gdb or strace) and
# any usage of /proc is blocked.  Many LD_ environment variables
# (e.g., LD_LIBRARY_PATH) are ignored in secure-execution mode.
# These restrictions only impact the executables listed below
# (external CloudI service OS processes remain unaffected).
