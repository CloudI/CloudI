# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   AX_CHECK_RQRD_CLASS tests the existence of a given Java class, either in
#   a jar or in a '.class' file and fails if it doesn't exist. Its success
#   or failure can depend on a proper setting of the CLASSPATH env.
#   variable.
#
#   Note: This is part of the set of autoconf M4 macros for Java programs.
#   It is VERY IMPORTANT that you download the whole set, some macros depend
#   on other. Unfortunately, the autoconf archive does not support the
#   concept of set of macros, so I had to break it for submission. The
#   general documentation, as well as the sample configure.in, is included
#   in the AX_PROG_JAVA macro.
