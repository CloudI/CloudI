==== Jun 21 2013 hd | doc ====
<li> Remove utf-8 encoding of binary data</li>
  <em>Rationale</em>: The user must ensure that data passed to the MySQL
  connection is already encoded in the right utf-8 format. The socket
  doesn't know about encoding. In turn, one can again send binary BLOB
  data over the driver.
<li> Fixes many small errors by merging two major Emysql branches</li>

<li> This addressed issue #22, thanks to TheSquad  </li>

Notes for March 26 2012:<br />

<b>Incompatible changes for automatic UTF-8 conversion.</b><br />

There are cases where the automatic conversion of parameters to prepared
statements has been changed and now behaves different than before. The
conversion now respects the encoding setting of the connection pool that it
is for, which you assigned when opening the pool.

There are extensive new tests checking as many sensible cases as possible, among
them 40+ 'human readable' cases in the files test/utf8_SUITE, test/latin_SUITE,
test/utf8_to_latindb_SUITE, test/latin_to_utf8db_SUITE. Please refer to these
first in cases where you have doubt about expected behavior in fringe cases.
