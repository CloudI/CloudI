Use of MySQL Conditional Use Logos
	
	Oracle has a family of MySQL Conditional Use Logos for those who
	wish to show their support for MySQL products and services by
	displaying such a logo in the user interface of a website. The MySQL
	Conditional Use Logos may be used without specific written
	permission from Oracle under these terms of the Third Party Usage
	Guidelines for Oracle Trademarks, Third Party Usage Guidelines for
	Oracle Logos, and the following conditions:

	* The use must not be detrimental, i.e., harmful or damaging, to
	the value of any of the MySQL Marks, or to Oracle, its brand
	integrity, reputation or goodwill, as determined by Oracle in its
	sole discretion;

	* The MySQL Conditional Use Logo must be a "clickable" link that
	leads directly to http://www.mysql.com/;

	* If the website has password-protected areas, the MySQL
	Conditional Use Logo must be placed only in areas that are not
	password-protected;

	* If used in an application released under the GPL license, the
	application must be able to connect directly to a MySQL server;

	* The limited license given herein does not include the right to
	use any MySQL Conditional Use Logo or any other Oracle Logo as a
	trademark to promote your own products or services. For example, no
	Oracle or MySQL Conditional Use Logo may be used on any product
	packaging or documentation, such as (without limitation) on CD-ROM
	or diskette labels or packaging, books or other publications. Any
	such use must be expressly authorized by Oracle in a signed, written
	agreement;

	* The use of any MySQL Conditional Use Logo under these terms
	must also comply with applicable provisions of the Third Party Usage
	Guidelines for Oracle Trademarks and Third Party Usage Guidelines
	for Oracle Logos.
