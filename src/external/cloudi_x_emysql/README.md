# Emysql

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Eonblast/Emysql.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Eonblast/Emysql)

To use this driver, see the [Samples] further down in this README document.

<hr/>

Emysql implements a stable driver toward the MySQL database. It currently support fairly recent versions (somewhere around 5.3+) and it is considered fairly stable in production.

The driver has several technical shortcomings:

* No clear protocol / connection pool separation
* No clear protocol / socket separation
* A very complicated connection pool management
* Uses the textual protocol in a lot of places where it shouldthe  binary protocol
* The API could be better

*However,* this is probably the best MySQL driver out there for Erlang. The `erlang-mysql-driver` uses a problematic connection pool design for many use cases and is not suitable for general purpose use. This driver is.

# Versioning

Semantic versioning is used. Versions are given as `x.y.z`:

* `x` changes break backward compatibility
* `y` changes add new functionalityâ€”but does not break compatibility backwards
* `z` changes recognizes a new version, but is not supposed to break anything

# Changelog of recent changes

## Emysql 0.4.1

Spring cleaning in the repository:

* Removed a lot of modules which is not part of the official API from the documentation.
* Deprecated the use of `emysql_util` for `emysql`.
* Made tests actually do something with the `emysql_util` calls.
* Moved function calls from `emysql_util` into the modules where they belong.

Change should be backwards compatible.

## Emysql 0.4.0

Introduced changes by Garrett Smith:

* Support connection timeouts in gen_tcp:connect/3. This allows the driver to better handle connection timeouts upon initial connections.
* Introduce `emysql:add_pool/2` as a proplist-based way of initializing a pool. This is going to be the preferred way of initializing pools in the future.

## Emysql 0.3.2

* We should be on Travis CI now with full tests running
* Pulled in lots of smaller changes which should be rather cosmetic fixes.
* R16 warnings eliminated (Jesse Gumm)
* Tried to consolidate simple parts of the driver

## Emysql 0.3.0

*Note:* Automatic conversion to the encoding of the underlying MySQL
server was removed in the 0.3.x branch. If you specify, e.g., utf-8
encoding, then the MySQL server will reject wrongly-encoded strings
and data, but the *driver* will not perform any encoding by itself
anymore.

It is now the driver *callers* responsibility to ensure that data is
properly encoded. This change makes it possible to pass binary BLOB
data to the MySQL server once again.

# Overview:

This is an Erlang MySQL driver, based on a rewrite at Electronic Arts. [Easy][Samples] to use, strong [connection pooling][Adding_a_Pool], [prepared statements][Executing_Prepared_Statements] & [stored procedures][Executing_Stored_Procedures]. Optimized for a central node architecture and OLTP.

While you can use mysql via ODBC, you should see better performance when using a *driver* like Emysql. For [samples][Samples] and [docs][] see below. Read the brief on [choosing][Choosing] a package and about the [history][History] of the various MySQL drivers.

[Emysql][1] is a cleaner rewrite of [erlang-mysql-driver][2], see [History][]. This fork is a direct continuation of the original [emysql][1] with [fixes][], [updates][], more [documentation][docs] and [samples][Samples]. 

**This is the master branch. Should you run into problems, please report them by opening an issue at github and try if they go away by checking out the 'stable' branch. Thank you.**

## Choosing                                             <a name="Choosing"></a>

#### Best
In most cases, especially for high performance and stability, this package, [Emysql][emysql], will be the best choice. It was rewritten from the ground up to overcome fundamental issues of 'erlang-mysql-driver'. It also has some usable docs meanwhile. 

#### Simple
If you are looking for the **plain necessities**, you should use the [ejabberd][7] mysql driver. It is simple, battle tested and stable. There are comprehensive instructions in the source comments.

#### Transaction

This driver currently does not support transactions.

For **mnesia-style transactions**, one of the multiple '[erlang-mysql-driver][22]s' may suite you best. There are [quite many][16] branches of it out there, and they are based on the same project as the ejabberd driver. To learn more about out the differences between the drivers, see the [mysql driver history][History].

## Samples                                             <a name=Samples></a>

### Hello World

This is a hello world program. Follow the three steps below to try it out. 
	
	-module(a_hello).
	-export([run/0]).
	
	run() ->
	
		crypto:start(),
		application:start(emysql),
	
		emysql:add_pool(hello_pool, 1,
			"hello_username", "hello_password", "localhost", 3306,
			"hello_database", utf8),
	
		emysql:execute(hello_pool,
			<<"INSERT INTO hello_table SET hello_text = 'Hello World!'">>),
	
	    Result = emysql:execute(hello_pool,
			<<"select hello_text from hello_table">>),
	
		io:format("~n~p~n", [Result]).


We'll be coming back to this source to make it run on your machine in a minute. But let's look at the basic building blocks first:

### Executing an SQL Statement

	emysql:execute(my_pool, <<"SELECT * from mytable">>).

For the exact spec, see below, [Usage][]. Regarding the 'pool', also see below.

### Executing a Prepared Statement

	emysql:prepare(my_stmt, <<"SELECT * from mytable WHERE id = ?">>).
	
	emysql:execute(my_pool, my_stmt, [1]).

### Executing Stored Procedures

	emysql:execute(my_pool, <<"create procedure my_sp() begin select * from mytable; end">>).
	
	emysql:execute(my_pool, <<"call my_sp();">>).

### Result Record

	-record(result_packet, {seq_num, field_list, rows, extra}).
	
### Converting Row Data To Records

	-record(foo, {bar, baz}).

	Result = emysql:execute(pool1, <<"select bar, baz from foo">>).
	Recs = emysql:as_record(Result, foo, record_info(fields, foo)).
	Bars = [Foo#foo.bar || Foo <- Recs].

### Adding a Connection to the Connection Pool

Emysql uses a sophisticated connection pooling mechanism.

	emysql:add_pool(my_pool, 1, "myuser", "mypass", "myhost", 3306,
      "mydatabase", utf8).

Arbitrary post-connection start-up commands can be added as a list of binaries
to the last `emysql:add_pool/9` argument:

	emysql:add_pool(my_pool, 1, "myuser", "mypass", "myhost", 3306,
      "mydatabase", utf8, [
          <<"SET TIME_ZONE='+00:00'">>,
          <<"SET SQL_MODE='STRICT_ALL_TABLES'">>
      ]).

### Running Hello World

Let's run the hello world sample from above:

#### 1. Build Emysql

Build emysql.app, using make:

	$ cd Emysql
	$ make

Or use rebar: 

	$ cd Emysql
	$ ./rebar compile

Both yield an option to install but this is not needed for the samples.

#### 2. Make a Sample Database

For use in the above sample (and all of those below, too), create a local mysql database. You should have a mysql server installed and running:
	
	$ mysql [-u<user> -p]
	mysql> create database hello_database;
	mysql> use hello_database;
	mysql> create table hello_table (hello_text char(20));
	mysql> grant all privileges on hello_database.* to hello_username@localhost identified by 'hello_password';

#### 3. Paste & Run Hello

Be sure to have ./ebin in your Erlang path. The hello-world source as shown above already waits in the Emysql directory, as hello.erl. Just compile and run it:

	$ erlc hello.erl
	$ erl -pa ./ebin -s hello run -s init stop -noshell

That's it. If you need to blindly repeat that more often some time, you can also use

	$ make hello

There are more sample programs:

## More Samples
Sample programs are in ./samples. 

* [a_hello](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/a_hello.erl) - Hello World
* [b_raw](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/b_raw.erl) - Hello World, raw output
* [c\_rows\_as\_records](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/c_rows_as_records.erl) - Using Erlang records to access result rows
* [d\_prepared\_statement](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/d_prepared_statement.erl) - Using prepared statements
* [e\_stored\_procedure](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/e_stored_procedure.erl) - Using stored procedures
* [f\_load\_from\_file](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/f_load_from_file.erl) - Fast loading of data from a flat file
* [g\_rows\_as\_json](http://github.com/Eonblast/Emysql/blob/master/samples/g_rows_as_json.erl) - Conversion of database rows into JSON

To run the samples, create the database as listed above at localhost, and simply run the compile & run batches:

	$ cd samples
	$ ./a_hello
	$ ./b_raw
	$ ./c_rows_as_records
	$ ./d_prepared_statement
	$ ./e_stored_procedure
	$ ./f_load_from_file
	$ ./g_rows_as_json
	
or (after building emysql.app and the database, as explained above), start a_hello etc. manually along these lines:

	$ make
	$ cd samples
	$ erlc a_hello.erl
	$ erl -pa ../ebin -s a_hello run -s init stop -noshell

## Usage                                                    <a name="Usage"></a>

General Notes on using Emysql, including the actual specs:

#### Starting an Application

The Emysql driver is an Erlang gen-server, and, application.

	crypto:start(), % Only needed for testing. In a proper release, this would happen automatically
	application:start(emysql).

#### Adding a Pool                                  <a name="Adding_a_Pool"></a>

To add a pool, you need to use one of the `emysql:add_pool/K` variants. I recommend using
`emysql:add_pool/2` which takes a proplist of parameters and is a bit easier to work with
rather than getting a parameter list correct. See the documentation for what options the
add_pool call accepts.

#### More Record Types

Emysql usually operates with a number of different record types from the database. The driver
returns "raw" responses as "packets" and leaves it up to the calling application to handle
the result, usually by using one of the conversion routines in `emysql` to turn the data into
a more suitable format.

	-record(result_packet, {seq_num, field_list, rows, extra}).
	
	-record(ok_packet, {seq_num, affected_rows, insert_id, status, warning_count, msg}).
	
	-record(error_packet, {seq_num, code, msg}).

For other record types, see include/emysql.hrl.

#### Executing SQL Statements

	% emysql:execute(PoolName, Statement) -> result_packet() | ok_packet() | error_packet()  
	% PoolName = atom()  
	% Statement = string() | binary()  
	
	emysql:execute(mypoolname, <<"SELECT * from mytable">>).
	# result_packet{field_list=[...], rows=[...]}
	
	emysql:execute(mypoolname, <<"UPDATE mytable SET bar = 'baz' WHERE id = 1">>).
	# ok_packet{affected_rows=1}

#### Executing Prepared Statements                          <a name="Executing_Prepared_Statements"></a>

	% emysql:prepare(StmtName, Statement) -> ok  
	% StmtName = atom()  
	% Statement = binary() | string()  
	
	emysql:prepare(my_stmt, <<"SELECT * from mytable WHERE id = ?">>).
	# ok

	% emysql:execute(PoolName, StmtName, Args) -> result_packet() | ok_packet() | error_packet()  
	% StmtName = atom()  
	% Args = [term()]  
	
	emysql:execute(mypoolname, my_stmt, [1]).
	#result_packet{field_list=[...], rows=[...]}

#### Executing Stored Procedures                          <a name="Executing_Stored_Procedures"></a>

	% emysql:execute(PoolName, StmtName, Args) -> result_packet() | ok_packet() | error_packet()  
	% StmtName = atom()  
	% Args = [term()]  
	
	emysql:execute(hello_pool,
		<<"create procedure sp_hello() begin select * from hello_table; end">>).
	{ok_packet,1,0,0,2,0,[]}
	
	emysql:execute(hello_pool, <<"call sp_hello();">>).
	[{result_packet,6,
	                [{field,2,<<"def">>,<<"hello_database">>,<<"hello_table">>,
	                        <<"hello_table">>,<<"hello_text">>,<<"hello_text">>,
	                        254,<<>>,33,60,0,0}],
	                [[<<"Hello World!">>],[<<"Hello World!">>]],
	                <<>>},
	{ok_packet,7,0,0,34,0,[]}]
 
 Note that you are getting back a list of results here.
 
#### Converting Row Data To Records

	% emysql:as_record(ResultPacket, RecordName, Fields) -> Result  
	% ResultPacket = result_packet()  
	% RecordName = atom() (the name of the record to generate)  
	% Fields = [atom()] (the field names to generate for each record)  
	% Result = [record()]  
	
	-module(fetch_example).
	-record(foo, {bar, baz, bat}).
	
	fetch_foo() ->
	   Result = emysql:execute(pool1, <<"select bar, baz, bat from foo">>),
	   Recs = emysql:as_record(Result, foo, record_info(fields, foo)),
	   [begin
		  io:format("foo: ~p, ~p, ~p~n", [Foo#foo.bar, Foo#foo.baz, Foo#foo.bat])
	    end || Foo <- Recs].

#### Converting Row Data To JSON

	% emysql:as_json(ResultPacket) -> Result
	% Result = [json()]

	Result = emysql:execute(pool1, <<"select bar, baz from foo">>),

	JSON = emysql:as_json(Result).
	% [[{<<"bar">>,<<"bar_value">>}, {<<"baz">>,<<"baz_value">>}], ...]

Note that you are getting back a list of erlang terms in accordance with EEP-18.
For actual utf8 binary JSON string you will need external library like [jsx](https://github.com/talentdeficit/jsx) or [jiffy](https://github.com/davisp/jiffy)

#### Loading Data From a File

	emysql:execute(hello_pool,
		<<"LOAD DATA INFILE 'hello.txt' INTO TABLE hello_table (hello_text)">>).

Note, you must grant: 
    
    grant file on *.* to hello_username@localhost identified by'hello_password';

You need to give LOCAL or an absolute path, else the file is expected in the database server root. To use the current directory:

    {ok, Dir} = file:get_cwd(),
	emysql:execute(hello_pool,
	    list_to_binary("LOAD DATA INFILE '" ++ Dir ++
	        "/hello.txt' INTO TABLE hello_table (hello_text)")).


## Tests                                             <a name="Tests"></a>

**Please add a Common Test suite if you are proposing a pull request!**

### Basic Tests

Some Common Tests (Unit Tests) have been added in the `test` folder. They have
no significant coverage yet but can help to test the basics. They might also 
help you find trip ups in your system set up (environment and basics suites). 

For the basic tests you only need the test database set up and a mysql server running, the same as described above for the samples:

	$ mysql [-u<user> -p]
	mysql> create database hello_database;
	mysql> use hello_database;
	mysql> create table hello_table (hello_text char(20));
	mysql> grant all privileges on hello_database.* to hello_username@localhost identified by 'hello_password';

To run the basic tests, at the command line type:

	make test

Some tests can take up to half a minute to finish on a slow machine.

These tests currently check access to the database (environment suite) the same functionality as the samples (basics suite) and for race conditions as described in issue #9. Thank you, Ransom!

To look at the tests, open `logs/index.html` in a browser:

	open logs/index.html # Will work on a Mac for instance

## History                                               <a name="History"></a>

Open Source Erlang MySQL driver efforts are a fractured matter. You may find yourself digging in the sources to find out about their relationships with each other - and which one to pick. Here is a brief history.

**Yxa:** The first Erlang MySQL driver, in [~270 lines][17] of code, seems to have been written between 2001 and 2004 by [Magnus Ahltorp][ma] at the Swedish [Royal Institute of Technology][3]. It exposes low level, blocking functions to talk 4.0 protocol with a MySQL server. In 2005 [Fredrik Thulin][fr] brought the driver into its current modular form to use it for the the SIP proxy [Yxa][5] while working at the [Stockholm University][19]. It has three process layers: a high level, round-robin connection pooling module; then, middle-man, single-connection, blocking processes that do the bit-level wrangling with the [MySQL protocol][18]. This module, mysql_conn, can also be used as a single-connection, stand-alone driver. And below this, there are small, protocol-agnostic receiver processes that handle the socket communication with the server, no matter the contents. Fredrik implemented gen-server behavior, added logging, error messages, upgraded authentication, and thoroughly commented the source. This [mysql driver][4] is working, complete and stable since at least 2007, it is available as part of [Yxa 1.0][5] (hosted on [github][6]). It has no support for transactions or stored procedures. It is the basis for the following two packages. Its basic modular division and general functionality were not changed but only enhanced and it had originally been agreed upon that the Yxa branch should receive and merge the contributions of the later forks upstream. Unfortunately, that did not come to pass.


**ejabberd:** In 2006, a [fork][7] of the Yxa driver was created by [Mickael Remond][mr] at [Process One][8] to become part of the successful instant messaging server [ejabberd][9] (also hosted on [github][10]). It can be assumed to be as stable as the Yxa branch, didn't change a byte in the lowest level, but only slightly enhanced the higher level. The difference from the original Yxa branch consists mainly of added inspection functions that help using the query results, and of an [independent adoption][11] of the MySQL 4.1 client-server protocol. The original Yxa branch has meanwhile adopted EDoc comment format, which makes the sources look more different than they actually are. You can find a Jan 2011 diff between Yxa and the ejabberd version [here][12], and one ignoring comments [here][13]. These two branches could be merged quite easily, probably without any change in functionality at all.

**erlang-mysql-driver:** The storied life of this branch began in 2006 when [Yariv Sadan][ys] created a fork from the ejabberd branch, made it a standalone project, gave it the maximally generic name that stuck, and hosted it on [Google Code][15]. Before he moved on to work at Facebook, he added high-level handling of prepared statements and transactions, and at long last completed some loose ends with the connection pooling that had been known to be lagging since the Yxa version. There were changes both in the original Yxa and the ejabberd branch after the forking off that never made their way into this fork, but in all likelihood they must be minor. It is not always obvious if the changes in erlang-mysql-driver had reached their intended final form. The separation of the three process layers seems to have suffered and complicated enhancements as the highest layer module, mysql.erl, started to become entangled with the second, mysql_conn.erl. Maybe that had a part in why the upstream merge never happened. The main repository of this fork lay dormant since Oct '07 when in Feb '10, Dave Smith, the rebar guy, started making some [updates][15] and put them on github. The driver is now enjoying a couple of active [forks][16] that make a convincing case for the github Network graphs.

A [parallel][20] fork from Yariv's branch, not entangled with Dave's tree, is [the one][22] by [Nick Gerakines][ng]. I suspect it could technically be the strongest of the erlang-mysql-driver forks, with a lot of clean up work by smart guys put in, although it is generally less well known. And much less forked. In the end, the branch was abandoned for [Emysql][]. In all branches, documentation beyond the source comments remains lacking.

**Emysql** was created from scratch in 2009, specifically to achieve better stability and throughput. It was proposed and written by [Jacob Vorreuter][jv] at Electronic Arts and deployed at Shawn Fanning's Rupture.com, a social network site for gamers. Initially, [Nick Gerakines][ng], Jacob's boss at EA, rewrote large parts of erlang-mysql-server to [clean it up][21]. But some fundamental problems remained and when half a year in, they still could not overcome performance and stability issues, Nick gave Jacob the green light to rewrite it from the ground up because they felt that, in Jacob's words, the Yxa branch had been touched by so many people that it had become more complicated than necessary. According to Jacob, [Bill Warnecke][bw] helped in the early design and testing. They abandoned the separation into three process layers and pulled the socket handling and bit-parsing into one module, coupling the functionality into direct function calls. It looks like they borrowed some chore lines from Magnus but generally created a new, straightforward architecture focused on providing a high performance node. Not only can Emysql open multiple connections, but multiple pools of multiple connections each to multiple database servers, which makes for a strong central OLTP node. Jacob says that Emysql is pretty stable and ran without issues in production at EA. Nick remembers: "The primary way we used it was to have a single Erlang node be the MySQL communication point and allow a number of connected nodes to connect through it to MySQL. We wanted very high throughput with many pids across a grid connecting to it and needed the ability to have a number of MySQL connections open for connection pooling." Rupture was killed in the consolidations of 2009. But Shawn could probably keep the money and we the fond memory of Napster and now, the glistening Emysql.

**Eonblast Emysql** is a continuation fork of [Jacob's work][1], including all his commits and adding [docs][], [samples][], [fixes][] and [extensions][24]. [Henning Diedrich][hd], [Vitaliy Batichko][vb], [Chris Rempel][cr], [Patrick Atambo][pa], [Joel Meyer][jm], [Erik Seres][es], [Alexey Lebedeff][al], [Logan Owen][lo], [Seven Du][sd], [Brendon Hogger][bh], [Bart van Deenen][bd], [Ransom Richardson][rr] and [Qing Liang][ql] have contributed to this branch. Support for stored procedures has been added, remaining issues are being addressed and there is work going on to bring Mnesia-style transactions. The fork is still close to the original, which currently lies dormant, but has started to add features and possibly increased stability.

Fredrik, Nick and Jacob helped shedding light on the matter. Thank you very much! Errors and omissions are [mine][hd]. Please let me know about any errors you may spot. Thanks. - Henning
