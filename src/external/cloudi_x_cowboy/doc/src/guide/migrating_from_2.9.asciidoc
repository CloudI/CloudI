  from RFC 5861.

=== Bugs fixed

* Fix a compilation error in Cowlib when using Erlang/OTP 26.

* Fix data sent after RST_STREAM in HTTP/2 in rare cases.

* Fix parsing of RST_STREAM frames to properly handle
  frames that have a valid length but were not fully
  received yet.

* Remove the obsolete `Version` cookie attribute.

* Handle more edge cases for cookie parsing based on updates
  to the RFC 6265bis draft.

* Make Basic auth parsing ignore unknown authentication
  parameters and generally update the code to conform
  to RFC 7617.
