::: HTTP status codes

This chapter aims to list all HTTP status codes that Cowboy
may return, with details on the reasons why. The list given
here only includes the replies that Cowboy sends, not user
replies.

Cowboy automatically sends a this status code before
trying to read the request body. This behavior can be
disabled using the appropriate body option.
