= Middleware example

To try this example, you need GNU `make` and `git` in your PATH.

Cowboy will serve all the files you put in the `priv` directory.
If you request a `.html` file that has a corresponding `.md` file
that has been modified more recently than the `.html` file, the
Markdown file will be converted to HTML and served by Cowboy.
