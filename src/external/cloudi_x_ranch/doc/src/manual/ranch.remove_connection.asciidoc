= ranch:remove_connection(3)

== Name

ranch:remove_connection - Remove connection from the count

== Description

[source,erlang]
----
remove_connection(Ref :: ranch:ref()) -> ok
----

Remove connection from the count.

This connection will no longer be included in the count when
limiting the number of connections. This can be useful in a
mixed environment where some connections are active and others
are passive. Passive connections spend most of their time idling 
and are not consuming much resources.

This function may only be called from a connection process.

== Arguments

Ref::

The listener name.

== Return value

The atom `ok` is always returned. It can be safely ignored.

== Examples
