== Types

=== max_conns()

[source,erlang]
----
max_conns() = non_neg_integer() | infinity
----

Maximum number of connections allowed per connection supervisor.

This is a soft limit. The actual number of connections
might be slightly above the limit due to concurrency
when accepting new connections. Some connections may
also be removed from this count explicitly by the user
code.

=== opts()

[source,erlang]
----
opts() = any() | transport_opts(any())
----

Transport or socket options.

It is possible to give the full transport options in a map
(see `transport_opts(SocketOpts)`), or only the socket options
(assuming they are not a map and no Ranch-specific option
needs to be given).

=== ref()

[source,erlang]
----
ref() = any()
----

Unique name used to refer to a listener.

=== transport_opts(SocketOpts)

[source,erlang]
----
transport_opts(SocketOpts) = #{
    connection_type   => worker | supervisor,
    handshake_timeout => timeout(),
    max_connections   => max_conns(),
    logger            => module(),
    num_acceptors     => pos_integer(),
    num_conns_sups    => pos_integer(),
    shutdown          => timeout() | brutal_kill,
    socket_opts       => SocketOpts
}
----

Transport options.

The transport options are a combination of Ranch-specific
options and transport-specific socket options.

None of the options are required.

connection_type (worker)::

Type of process that will handle the connection.

handshake_timeout (5000)::

Maximum allowed time for the `ranch:handshake/1,2` call to finish.

logger (logger)::

The module that will be used to write log messages.

max_connections (1024)::

Maximum number of active connections per connection supervisor.
Soft limit. Use `infinity` to disable the limit entirely.

num_acceptors (10)::

Number of processes that accept connections.

num_conns_sups - see below::

Number of processes that supervise connection processes.
If not specified, defaults to be equal to `num_acceptors`.

shutdown (5000)::

Maximum allowed time for children to stop on listener shutdown.

socket_opts::

Socket options to be used by `Transport:listen/1`. Please refer to the
documentation of the transport module you are using for more details.

== Changelog

* *2.0*: The type `transport_opts(SocketOpts)` was added.
* *2.0*: The function `ranch:accept_ack/1` was removed in favor of
         link:man:ranch:handshake(3)[ranch:handshake(3)].
* *2.0*: The option `max_connections` is now per connection supervisor.
* *2.0*: The `num_conns_sup` option was added.
* *2.0*: The `socket` option was removed.
* *2.0*: The `logger` option is no longer experimental. It now defaults
         to `logger` instead of `error_logger`.
* *2.0*: The `opt()` type was removed.
* *1.6*: The experimental `logger` option was added.
* *1.6*: The `opt()` type was deprecated in favor of the new `opts()` type.
