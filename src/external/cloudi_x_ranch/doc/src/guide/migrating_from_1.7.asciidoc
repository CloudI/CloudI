== Migrating from Ranch 1.7 to 1.8

Ranch 1.8 is a compatibility update for Erlang/OTP 24.

Ranch 1.8 is compatible with Erlang/OTP 21.0 onward. Support
for Erlang/OTP 19 and 20 has been removed.

=== Bugs fixed

* An issue with the PROXY protocol was fixed in Ranch 1.7.1.
  The wrong CRC32 algorithm was used and would cause
  checksum verification to fail when used. The configuration
  value when building PROXY headers has been changed to
  `crc32c` to reflect the correct algorithm.
