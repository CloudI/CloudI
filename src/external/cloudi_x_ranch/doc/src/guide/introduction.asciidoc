with a small code base and low latency while being easy to use directly
as an application or to embed into your own.

=== Prerequisites

It is assumed the developer already knows Erlang and has some experience
with socket programming and TCP protocols.

=== Supported platforms

Ranch is tested and supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OSX and Windows.

Ranch is developed for Erlang/OTP 19+.

Ranch may be compiled on earlier Erlang versions with small source code
modifications but there is no guarantee that it will work as expected.
