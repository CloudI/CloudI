principe: need to test against fixed-length TT databases.

principe_table: schema converter? a fun that you pass in (perhaps
as a module parameter) which automatically performs input/output
type conversion for column values and will convert column keys to
atoms. This would basically be the equivalent of native term storage
for table mode, but in a manner that does not make the various
table search functions useless.

medici: need to flesh-out/test support for running multiple medici
instances (e.g. one for tyrant server A and one for tyrant server B)

medici: add eunit test
