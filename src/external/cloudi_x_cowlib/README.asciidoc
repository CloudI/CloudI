= Cowlib

Cowlib is a support library for manipulating Web protocols.

== Goals

Cowlib provides libraries for parsing and building messages
for various Web protocols, including HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 and
Websocket.

It is optimized for completeness rather than speed. No value
is ignored, they are all returned.
