This file is an agreement between Quviq AB ("Quviq"), Sven Hultins
Gata 9, Gothenburg, Sweden, and the committers to the github
repository in which the file appears ("the owner"). By placing this
file in a github repository, the owner agrees to the terms below.

The purpose of the agreement is to enable Quviq AB to provide a
continuous integration service to the owner, whereby the code in the
repository ("the source code") is tested using Quviq's test tools, and
the test results are made available on the web. The test results
include test output, generated test cases, and a copy of the source
code in the repository annotated with coverage information ("the test
results").

The owner agrees that Quviq may run the tests in the source code and
display the test results on the web, without obligation.

The owner warrants that running the tests in the source code and
displaying the test results on the web violates no laws, licences or other
agreements. In the event of such a violation, the owner accepts full
responsibility.

The owner warrants that the source code is not malicious, and will not
mount an attack on either Quviq's server or any other server--for
example by taking part in a denial of service attack, or by attempting
to send unsolicited emails.

The owner warrants that the source code does not attempt to reverse
engineer Quviq's code.

Quviq reserves the right to exclude repositories that break this
agreement from its continuous integration service.

Any dispute arising from the use of Quviq's service will be resolved
under Swedish law.
