==========================================================================================================
MISULTIN - An Erlang library for building fast lightweight HTTP servers.
<http://code.google.com/p/misultin/>

>-|-|-(°>


INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================================================

1. Compile

Run the appropriate script:

    * OSX | Linux users:  make
    * Windows users: make.bat. Note that Erlang bin directory (by default, C:\Program Files\erl5.7.2\bin\) must be in your path for the script to work.

This script will compile the .erl files in the Misultin src directory and save the compiled files into the ebin directory.

2. (Optional) Copy Misultin files

This optional step will allow Misultin to be called from modules running from any directory on your file system.

Locate the directory where Erlang is installed on your system. Under OSX and Linux, it should be something similar to /usr/local/lib/erlang/ or /usr/lib/erlang/. Under Windows, Erlang is installed by default in something similar to C:\Program Files\erl5.7.2\ (version changes may apply).

Browse into the lib directory under this Erlang root and copy the root misultin-0.x directory into this directory. You should now have Misultin under something similar to:

    * OSX | Linux users: /usr/local/lib/erlang/lib/misultin-0.x/
    * Windows users: C:\Program Files\erl5.7.2\lib\misultin-0.x\ 

3. Test

If you did proceed with step 2, CD to the Misultin examples directory and start an Erlang shell.

If you did not proceed with step 2, copy the file misultin_hello_world.erl from the Misultin examples directory to the directory where the .beam files compiled in step 1 are located, then CD to this directory and start an Erlang shell.

In the shell, compile and run misultin_hello_world by issuing:

(one@rob.loc)1>c(misultin_hello_world).
{ok,misultin_hello_world}
(one@rob.loc)2>misultin_hello_world:start(8080).
{ok,<0.50.0>}

Open your favourite browser and point it to http://localhost:8080/, you should read "Hello World." printed on your page.

You may now stop the misultin_hello_world HTTP server:

(one@rob.loc)3>misultin_hello_world:stop().

4. Congratulations!

You're ready to go.

       - added ws_autoexit option which allows to get an event on websocket controlling processes [issue track #15, suggestion of esente]
       - added headers also in misultin websockets [thanks to jlirochon]
       - made it basho's rebar friendly [thanks to mrinalwadhwa]

0.6:   - added HTTP compression option
       - refactoring of the main server loop, so that it is now isolated from the HTTP functionality
       - removed unnecessary compilation warnings

       - bug correction: removed erroneous sending of response timeout on listening open connections
       - added stream_support optimization option

0.3:   - reengineering of the listener process, using active instead of passive mode in request parsing,
         except for BODY where passive is still used [thanks to Lev Walkin]
